# Clevo-NS50MU automatic fan control

> Cloned from https://gitlab.com/vega-d/clevo-ns50mu-fan-controller

BIOS fan control of my laptop was kinda too noisy, so I adapted a project for ns50mu. 

* check in-processor temperature every 0.5s,
* shut-down fan if temp is below 65°C,
* gently speeds the fan up as cpu temperature rises.

**In most computers, there is a (bios-level) temperature cut-off that will brutally cause it to power-off before any damage occurs. However, this software comes without waranty, by using it your computer may overheat and be damaged. Although it runs very well on my own device, I am not be responsible for any consequence that may occur.**

That being said, I never reached 90°C with this controller.

## Prerequisites

Since this is C++, for this to compile you will need `gcc` and `build-essential`.

On debian-based distros (Ubuntu, ...) you can install them with this command:

```
sudo apt install -y git gcc build-essential
```

## Installing

Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/vega-d/clevo-ns50mu-fan-controller.git
```

Go into the project folder:

```
cd clevo-ns50mu-fan-controller
```

Build & install:

```
sudo make all
```

This will:

1. build the c++ file into NS50MU-fan-controller and make it executable,
2. copy NS50MU-fan-controller bin file into /usr/local/bin,
3. copy the service file ns50mu-fan-controller.service into /etc/systemd/system/,
4. enable the service at startup,
5. launch the service.

You can now check that the service is running:

```
systemctl status NS50MU-fan-controller.service
```
## Note

To watch for the temperature of your cpu (for example with a desktop widget), you can use the following command (in millidegrees):

```
cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp
```

If you want the daemon to write logs in syslog, use `sudo make -VERBOSE=ON all`.
